About
-----

TinyCThread is a minimalist, portable, threading library for C, intended to
make it easy to create multi threaded C applications.

The library is closesly modeled after the C11 standard, but only a subset is
implemented at the moment.

See the documentation in the doc/html directory for more information.


Using TinyCThread
-----------------

To use TinyCThread in your own project, just add tinycthread.c and
tinycthread.h to your project. In your own code, do:

#include <tinycthread.h>
