  ** To perform an immediate shutdown use `kill`.  If the pool has

  **
  ** Max duration an actor will work processing messages before yielding its
  ** thread.  Because actors require cooperative multi-tasking we don't
  ** want to let an actor hog a thread forever and potentially starve out
  ** other actors waiting for a thread.  Note its possible for an actor to
  ** work longer than this time (especially if its blocking on I/O).  However
  ** once this time has expired, the actor will not process subsequent messages
  ** in its queue.  As an optimization an actor will never yield unless
  ** the pool has other actors waiting for a thread.
  **
  ** NOTE: this method is marked as NoDoc, it is provided for low level
  ** access to tune the actor pool, but it is subject to change.
